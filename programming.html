                            <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
                            <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>

                            <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
                            <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
                            <li>Iterative (Looping):
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;while loop: continue looping as long something is true
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for loop: loop a given number of times

                        <h3>Two Classic Programming/Database Problems</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorting numbers
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)
                            </li>
                            <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In database:
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filters: temporary search
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated
                            </li>
                            <li>Two popular search techniques:
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary search:
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only works if data is SORTED first
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

They use automated testing tools that are part of the deployment process.
